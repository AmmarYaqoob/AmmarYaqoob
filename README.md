# 👋 Hi, I’m Ammar

Backend-focused Software Engineer working primarily on **fintech platforms**.  
I build **scalable APIs, cloud-ready services, and automation tools** with a strong focus on simplicity, performance, and maintainability.

I enjoy working on systems that **scale cleanly without over-engineering**.  
Currently learning **DevOps practices and Python**, and open to contributing to meaningful open-source projects.
